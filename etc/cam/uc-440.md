# Arducam UC-440

The Arducam UC-440 is a 15-pin to 22-pin FPC cable adapter used to connect standard 15-pin Raspberry Pi cameras to 22-pin camera ports found on models like the Raspberry Pi Zero, Pi 5,
or Compute Module IO boards. The pin mapping is a direct passthrough of the signals, where the 15-pin signals map to corresponding pins within the 22-pin connector.
