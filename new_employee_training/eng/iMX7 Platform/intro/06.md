# CL-SOM-iMX7: System Boot

The aim is understanding NXP i.MX7 boot process and how it's implemented and assured in CL-SOM-iMX7

:memo: **Note:** The therm "boot" relate to Firmware boot!!!

## i.MX7: System Boot
1) Download [i.MX 7Dual Applications Processor](https://www.nxp.com/products/processors-and-microcontrollers/arm-processors/i-mx-applications-processors/i-mx-7-processors/i-mx-7dual-processors-heterogeneous-processing-with-dual-arm-cortex-a7-cores-and-cortex-m4-core:i.MX7D) Reference Manual document
2) Refer to `System Boot` section and read about 
    * Boot modes and unterlying pin settings
    * Internal Boot mode
    * Boot devices
    
## CL-SOM-iMX7: Boot Sequence
1) Download CL-SOM-iMX7 Reference Guide from the Product's [`Webpage`](https://www.compulab.com/products/computer-on-modules/cl-som-imx7-freescale-i-mx-7-system-on-module)
2) Refer to the `Boot Sequence` section and read about Firmware Boot
3) Obtain CL-SOM-iMX7 Schematics (disk `N`) 
4) Refer to `BOOT STRAPS` section to see how the above mentioned Boot Sequence is implemented and assured

## Booting from internal / removable storage devices
1) Refer to the [`U-Boot Documentation`](https://mediawiki.compulab.com/w/index.php?title=CL-SOM-iMX7_NXP_i.MX7_U-Boot) and prepare bootable SD card
2) Try booting from either internal or external (removable) boot devices and double check if it's consistent with the theory learned before.

## Required equipment (contact Ilya / Valentin / Dimitry for assistance):
1) SBC-iMX7 with PS and cables, LCD panel or DVI display
2) uSD card + adaptor
3) Card reader

## Please prepare a quick demo to show progress (SBC-iMX7 boots from internal / external devices, how to use primary and alt boot sequence)

Please do not hesitate to contact Ilya / Valentin / Dimitry with any question/issue you have.
