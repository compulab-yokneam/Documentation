# CL-SOM-iMX7: U-Boot: Scripting

The topic is u-boot scripting and using "boot.scr" for overriding Linux boot sequence pre-defined by CL-SOM-iMX7 u-boot environment.
## U-Boot Scripting
1) Install `u-boot-tools` package on the host machine
2) Find examples how to use mkimage utility for compiling u-boot scripts. E.g.
    * [`#1`](https://mediawiki.compulab.com/w/index.php?title=U-Boot:_Images)
    * [`#2`](https://ece453.engr.wisc.edu/u-boot-script/)
3) Create, put on SD-card and and test simple u-boot scripts:
    * "Hello World!" - simple script, that prints out some message and continies to the next step in the boot sequence
    * Same as previous, but prevents further booting
    * Script that loads `zImage-moby-comp` kernel image instead of default `zImage`
    * Script that loads kernel and dtb from SD card, but sets eMMC as root device in bootargs
    * Any other scripts as you wish

## Required equipment (contact Ilya / Valentin / Dimitry for assistance):
1) SBC-iMX7 with PS and cables, LCD panel or DVI display
2) uSD card + adaptor
3) Card reader
4) USB disk-on-key
5) Gigabit Ethernet Switch
6) Ethernet cables

## Please prepare a quick demo to show progress for each script

Please do not hesitate to contact Ilya / Valentin / Dimitry with any question/issue you have.
