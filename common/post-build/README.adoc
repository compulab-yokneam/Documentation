## How to Deploy:
[%hardbreaks]
This chapter shows how to deploy different sdcard images.

NOTE: Let's assume that the sdcard device file is *`/dev/sdg`*

The created image can be in either: `sdcard/sdcard.xz/sdcard.bz2` format. + 

* for `sdcard.xz` image issue:
[source,console]
$: xz -dc tmp/deploy/images/${MACHINE}/${IMAGE}-${MACHINE}.sdcard.xz | sudo dd of=/dev/sdg

* for `sdcard.bz2` image issue:
[source,console]
$: bzip2 -dc tmp/deploy/images/${MACHINE}/${IMAGE}-${MACHINE}.sdcard.bz2 | sudo dd of=/dev/sdg

* for `sdcard` image issue:
[source,console]
$: sudo dd if=tmp/deploy/images/${MACHINE}/${IMAGE}-${MACHINE}.sdcard of=/dev/sdg

## How to Evaluate:
. Insert the sd-card into the SB-FX6 P6 slot
. Power up the device
. Stop in U-Boot
. Issue:
[%hardbreaks]
[source,console]
# env default -a
# savenv
# reset
. Let the device boot up
. Evaluate this Yocto Release
