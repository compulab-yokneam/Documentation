# GPIO how to

Here are two options:

# Option #1 (if the image is already deployed onto the eMMC)

* Download *.deb files from this https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1CrKuV57plLNn1b8ep7Qh57pdYNbyoPf4[debs' location]
* Copy the file to the device and issue this sequence (`cl-deploy.mod` assumes that the device is eMMC):
```
sudo -i
dpkg -i /path/to/deb-packages-folder/*.deb
DST=/dev/mmcblk2 source /usr/local/bin/cl-deploy.mod
umount /boot
dpkg -i /path/to/deb-packages-folder/*.deb
```
* Reboot the machine and select the `ucm-imx8m-plus-p21.dtb`.
* Let the device boot up.

# Option #2

* Download the lates Debian image from this https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12RsBbaMpxagxUQFa3k8x3ZbsH-0TPGtW[images' location]
* Create a bootable sd-card.
* Issue AltBoot.
* Issue cl-deploy and install it into the eMMC:
```
DST=/dev/mmcblk2 QUIET=Yes cl-deploy
```
* Issue cl-uboot:
```
IMX_DEV=/dev/mmcblk2boot0 IMX_BOOT=/boot/imx-boot-ucm-imx8m-mini-sd.bin-flash_evk QUIET=Yes cl-uboot
```
* Power off
* Remove the sd-card.
* Power on the machine and select the `ucm-imx8m-plus-p21.dtb`.

# Using GPIO P21
* Follow the https://embeddedbits.org/new-linux-kernel-gpio-user-space-interface/[gpio manual] for controlling the P21[11-23] pins.
