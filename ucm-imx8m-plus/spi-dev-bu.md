# A new SPI device bring-up
1) Configure an spidev "rohm,dh2228fv" on the required spi bus with the correct cs.
2) Use the spidev_test and perform an input request from the device
  2.1) Make sure that the spidev_test return no error. Go to the step #3
  2.2) the spidev_test failed; make sure that the device connected correctly & fix all connectivityâ€™s issues.
3) Define the real spi device not on the same bus and the cs.
4) Enable the driver that matches the device node compatibility string.
5) If the driver is not found in the kernel source tree, talk the hw provider and ask for the Linux kernel driver source code.
  5.1) Compile the driver in | out the compatible kernel source.
  5.2) Copy the kernel object to the rootfs and load it.
